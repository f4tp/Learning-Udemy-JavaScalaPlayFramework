# Routes

# Get = HTTP verb| / = URI path pattern |
#controllers.at... = action

#A GET request with the URI /example will call what ever is in the exampleAction() in the given Controller
GET     /example       controllers.ExampleController.exampleAction()

POST    /example-body  controllers.ExampleController.exampleBodyAction()



#when a GET request is received...
#...on the root context
#call the method controllers.Assets.at the given address
GET     /               controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file="index.html")

#wildcard pattern (* below) = can be used to capture parts of the URI path
#if a GET request come in...
#and its path matches a forward slash followed by any amount of text
#store that extra text in a variable called file, and...
#call the at method in the specified controller, with...
#the public path, and the 'file' variable
#doing the above allows you to view files in the public folder directly with a standard HTTP GET request
#this thing below will fault any other direct route set, so needs to be added at the bottom to be teh last
#toute checked
GET     /*file          controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file)

#below was used to solve the test question
#what ever is specified as the URI is the exact thing that has to be typed to return the file at the given path
#GET     /indexTwo.html       controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file="indexTwo.html")
