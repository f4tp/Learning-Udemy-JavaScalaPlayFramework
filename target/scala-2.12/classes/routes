# Routes

#typical routes below
# An example controller showing a sample home page
#GET     /                           controllers.HomeController.index

# Map static resources from the /public folder to the /assets URL path
#GET     /assets/*file               controllers.Assets.versioned(path="/public", file: Asset)

# Get = HTTP verb| / = URI path pattern |
#controllers.at... = action

#when a GET request is received...
#...on the root context
#call the method controllers.Assets.at the given address
GET     /       controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file="index.html")

#wildcard pattern (* below) = can be used to capture parts of the URI path
#if a GET request come in...
#and its path matches a forward slash followed by any amount of text
#store that extra text in a variable called file, and...
#call the at method in the specified controller, with...
#the public path, and the 'file' variable
#doing the above allows you to view files in teh public folder directly with a standard HTTP GET request
#GET     /*file  controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file)


GET     /indexTwo.html       controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file="indexTwo.html")
